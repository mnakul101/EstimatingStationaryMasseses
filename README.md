# EstimatingStationaryMasseses
Experiments for estimating the stationary masses of a mixing sequence frequency by frequency.

This repo contains Python notebook having a linear time implementation of the Windowed Good--Turing (WingIT) estimator. The details of the estimation procedure can be found in the following paper:

"Nakul, M., Muthukumar, V., & Pananjady, A. (2025). Estimating stationary mass, frequency by frequency. arXiv preprint arXiv:2503.12808."
